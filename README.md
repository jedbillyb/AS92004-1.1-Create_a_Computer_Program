# AS92004 1.1 – Create a Computer Program

This project was created for **NCEA AS92004 (1.1)** and achieved **Excellence**.

The program is a **text-based Python application** that simulates a holiday camp booking system.  
It collects user input, validates it, makes decisions using conditions, and calculates a final cost based on choices.

---

## What the Program Does

The program:
- Asks the user for their **name** and **age**
- Checks the age is within the allowed range (5–17)
- Displays different messages based on age (camp leader eligibility)
- Allows the user to choose:
  - An **activity**
  - A **meal preference**
  - Whether they want a **shuttle bus**
- Calculates the **total cost**
- Asks the user to **confirm or cancel** the booking

## Key Programming Concepts Used

This project demonstrates the following concepts required for AS92004:

- Variables and constants  
- Lists  
- Input and output  
- Selection (if / elif / else)  
- Iteration (while loops)  
- Subroutines (functions)  
- Error handling using `try` / `except`  
- Data validation (checking user input is valid)

---

## Requirements

- Python **3.10 or newer**
- Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- No external libraries required

---

## Installation

1. Download the file:
   ```
   AS92004-1.1.py
   ```

2. Make sure Python is installed:
   ```

   ```

---

## Usage

Run the program in a terminal:

```bash
python AS92004-1.1.py
```

Then follow the on-screen instructions and answer the questions.
